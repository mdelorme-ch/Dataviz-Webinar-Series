With 67 km, it\'s the second-longest light rail service worldwide. The interactive map is created with #Leaflet using the Alidade Smooth basemap from Stadia.',

Each dot on the map shows the location of a supermarket. The coloured areas indicate how long it takes to get to the nearest REWE by foot. An isochrone is a boundary on a map that connects points reachable within the same amount of travel time from a specific location. It shows areas accessible in equal travel times. It\'s the first time I created such an isochrone map. I used R and the following key packages: üìå tidygeocoder - to geocode the addresses of the REWE supermarkets;üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è osrm - to access the OSRM routing API and to calculate walking distances; üõ£ osmdata - to load the street data for the base map',
