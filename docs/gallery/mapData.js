        description: 'Because the earth is a globe, maps have to distort the earth in some way to be presented on a 2D surface. Each of these "ways of distorting" are what we GIS-folk call "map projections". The projection shown here is the Spilhaus Projection, which is handy for seeing all of the world's oceans (ocean?) in one place. I love that this projection forces us to realize how connected the oceans really are. I created this map as part of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge.',
