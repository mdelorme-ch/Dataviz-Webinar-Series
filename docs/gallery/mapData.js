In this format, each district is represented by five equally-sized hexagons, ensuring that each congressional seat is given equal visual weight.

This truncation is necessary because beyond these latitudes, the distortion becomes so severe that the projection would fail to provide a meaningful representation of the Earth\'s surface. The poles, at 90¬∞ latitude, lie outside this truncated range, and hence, they cannot be accurately represented. To make accurate maps of the polar regions, we use special projections that are designed to handle these areas, like the Polar Stereographic projection.
